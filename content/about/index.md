Hello! 

I am glad to welcome you on my site! My name is Aleksandra Pieszka and I am 25.

I studied Biomedical Engineering at AGH Univeristy of Science and Technology in Cracow. I specialised in biomaterials. 

I had an opportunity to live in Oslo for 3 months. At the Institute of Clinical Dentistry at the Faculty of Dentristy at the Univeristy of Oslo I did a 3-month traineeship. I focused on titanium dioxide bone grafts and possibilities of their modification with WPI protein and calcium phosphate precipitates. 

Later, I came back to Poland and got back to manual and automation testing in telecommunication sector.

Other than that I love hiking, spending time outdoor (this is called in Norwegian _friluftsliv_) and drink coffee. 
Recently I started horse riding in my free time. 

If you'd like to contact do not hesitate and text me on LinkedId (link can be found in Resume section).

Have an awesome day!
Ola
