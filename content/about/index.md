Hello! 

I am glad to welcome you on my site! I hope that you will find there something interesting and that you will stay here longer. 

I am a 24 year old girl from Kozakowice GÃ³rne, Poland. I studied Biomedical Engineering at AGH Univeristy of Science and Technology in Cracow. I specialise in biomaterials. 

Currently I live in Oslo. Here, at the Institute of Clinical Dentistry at the Faculty of Dentristy at the Univeristy of Oslo I do a 3-month traineeship. I focus on titanium dioxide bone grafts and possibilities of their modification with WPI protein and calcium phosphate precipitates. 

Other than that I love hiking, spending time outdoor (this is called in Norwegian _friluftsliv_) and drink coffee. 

If you are interested in any particular field of my work and would like to discuss it don't hesitate to use my [e-mail](ola.pieszka@gmail.com). 

See you on the trail!
Ola
