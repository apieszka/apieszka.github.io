    Two days ago, a little bit later than I planned I managed to go hiking with my sister. I must say that it was rather easy and not demanding trail. It was the very first expedition in this new year and I wanted to stand on the mountain path as soon as possible no matter at what level the trail is. Our tour started in my home. Here we prepared hot, sweetened tea with lemon, two bananas, flashlights, a map and a power bank - the most important items in the mountains. Then we took my reliable car and went to Brenna.

    Brenna is a well-known countryside in my region and is not so far away from my home. After 25 minutes we got our destination. We left the car on the car-park close to the trail and we hit the road. Though the trail had slight elevation after a few minutes I got shortness of my breath. Well, after Christmas stodge I didn't expect anything else. The trail was empty. We could take our time to admire all trees  - birches, spruces, larches and beeches covered in a fresh snowfall. It is rarer and rarer in winter to see daily such a view. Luckily we live in the beautiful Beskidy mountains... My home.

    After about an hour we got the highest point of our trekking - the Lovers' Cross, which was founded in 1936 by the local priest to commemorate the story of two lovers. Because of their financial status, the lovers couldn't be together. The cross is the spot of their last meeting.
