Hi people!

I am in Norway! Yes. That is real true. I am really in Oslo, Norway. I live here almost for a month. 
That is incredible. I mean incredible for me. I am proud of myself, that I managed to do that. It was not difficult, but not easy though. 

So how did that happen? 
I was invited by a professor from University of Oslo for a traineeship here at his Department in the end of April. And i one month and two weeks I got finances that gave me opportunity to find accomodation here and alaso book flight tickets. 

By know this is all you need to know. I am really happy to be there. 

Best, 
Ola
